# WoollyM DataFrame

The aim of this manual is to provide an overview of the features offered by WoollyM, while remaining didactic and readable, and therefore not perfectly exhaustive.

We recommend that you read the [Getting Started](/Getting_Started/) section first.
And in particular the following pages, which are fundamental to understanding the underlying logic and instantiation:
* [Architecture principles](/Getting_Started/Architecture_Principles)
* [Data vocabulary & principles](/Getting_Started/Data_Vocabulary_Principles)
* [Instanciation](/Getting_Started/Instanciation)
